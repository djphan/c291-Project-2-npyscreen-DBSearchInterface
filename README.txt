-------
 USAGE
-------

To run the program, type into a command shell (in this directory):

./mydbtest <arg>

where <arg> is one of:
btree
hash
indexfile

IMPORTANT: Make sure your terminal is at the default size (80 x 24) or greater,
otherwise the interface may crash.

The "Create and populate the database" function will take a significant amount
of time (~1 minute). The program will appear to freeze while the database is
being populated; you will know that it is done when the > < arrows disappear.
